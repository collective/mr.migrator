1.1 (2015-10-22)
----------------

- Remove browserlayer registration, so the ``mr.migrator`` doesn't have to be
  installed to be used. Calling ``/@@mr.migrator`` is enough.

- Add uninstallation profile.
  [thet]

- Allow any pipeline configuration to be imported through the web at the
  ``@@mr.migrator`` view. Previously, only those pipelines were shown, which
  had a ``plone.app.transmogrifier.atschemaupdater`` blueprint included. Now
  any pipelines can be used, e.g. those which handle only Dexterity objects.
